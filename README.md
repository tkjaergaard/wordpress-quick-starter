# Wordpress Quick Starter

Simple quick starter script for local Wordpress development.


## Installation

clone this repository

    git clone git@github.com:tkjaergaard/wordpress-starter-template.git

Move the wp.sh file to you `/bin/` or `/usr/local/bin` directory and make it executable:
	
	sudo mv wp.sh /bin/wp
	sudo chmod +x /bin/wp

## Usage

Change directory to where you wanna install Wordpress and run the wp command.

	cd ~/Wordpress-dir/
	wp



## Boilerplate

The script clones my [wordpress-starter-template](https://github.com/tkjaergaard/wordpress-starter-template) into the themes directory for you to get started.

## Notice

The command is setup for my current setup at my OSX machine, and you might wanne change some things in the script if you intend to use it. But it might be a good boilerplate to automate you wordpress installation workflow.
